Even the ethics of the Empire is decided by the masses, in a bi-yearly plebiscite open to all citizens."

 tyranny_majority.1000.desc:0 "The moral code of our Empire should reflect the moral code of our citizens. But in a rapidly changing society like ours, they can sometimes get out of sync. It's time for our bi-yearly plebiscite to see our population's stance in numerous ethical dilemmas."

 tyranny_majority.12.desc:0 "To most of our people, society should benefit the individual, but not the other way around. Only by preserving essential individual freedoms we can grow as an Empire."

 tyranny_majority.31.desc:0 "A strong military force is important to all aspects of our peoples' lives. Our citizens may not be actively looking for war, but are not shunning away from it either."
 tyranny_majority.32.desc:0 "'Why must we fight?', our people asks. Conflict and violence is a sad reality of our world. We should try our best to stay away from it."
 tyranny_majority.33.desc:0 "A war has no winners, only losers; and the victim may lose his life, land and family, but the aggressor loses his dignity forever."

 tyranny_majority.42.desc:0 "The illusory nature of matter has not blinded our people. They know that only by fortifying our spirits we have any hope to keep evolving."

 tyranny_majority.44.desc:0 "Our people has no strong stance toward neither Materialism nor Spiritualism."
